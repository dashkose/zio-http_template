If you don't have [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org) installed already, you can use the provided wrapper script:

```shell
./sbtx test # run the tests
./sbtx run # run the application (Main)
```

For more details check the [sbtx usage](https://github.com/dwijnand/sbt-extras#sbt--h) page.

Otherwise, if sbt is already installed, you can use the standard commands:

```shell
sbt test # run the tests
sbt run # run the application (Main)
```

### To run application locally

If you are on *nix system you can use
```shell
source .envrc
```
to export environment variables before running application.
Then you can run normal `sbt run` command
Http server will start on the port specified.

### To run application in Docker
You can execute command `sbt publishLocal` to publish Docker image locally.
You should set HTTP_HOST and HTTP_PORT environment variables.
If you are on *nix system you can use
```shell
source .envrc
```
to export environment variables before running application.
Then bring it up with a command `docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml up`
Http server will start on the port specified.
